A LETTER FROM AUNT
ETIQUETTE</h2>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">This is the tale of Pretty Bunny,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And though her story is very funny,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To read it you will not regret</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When you meet old Aunt Etiquette!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny Manners lived with Old
Father and Mother Bun, in a little wee
house in the woods.</p>

<p>As soon as she woke one morning she
called to her brother, Healthy Bunny,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pretty Bunny gives fair warning,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">She will always call, ‘Good morning’.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Healthy Bunny often forgot to say
“Good morning,” and be polite, so Pretty
Bunny continued, “I will make up a
‘Good Morning Song’,” so she wrote on a
card some words for Healthy Bunny to
learn, and soon they sang to the tune
of “Twinkle Little Star,”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Say ‘Good Morning’ when you wake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Be polite, make no mistake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And when friends you chance to meet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Say ‘Good Morning’ on the street.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They took so long learning the song
that Old Father Bun cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hurry your dressing, I don’t like to scold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">But your coffee will all be cold.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hurry up, Bunnies, as like as not,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Your oat-meal will get too hot.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Bunnies laughed and,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Hippety-hop with never a care,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They came dancing down the stairs.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They said ‘Good Morning’ to Old Father
and Mother Bun and began to eat
breakfast.</p>

<p>At this very minute the Postman
came “pitter, patter, rap-a-tap,” and left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
some letters in the mail-box; among
them was a certain pink envelope addressed
to Old Father Bun.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny went to get the letters
and came dancing in, handing them to
Old Father Bun.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, Old Father Bun
took up the pink envelope first and
looked at it closely through his horn-rimmed
spectacles.</p>

<p>He said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“This handwriting I’ve seen before,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Two or four times, six or more.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun remarked, as he
passed her the letter,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Whom can it be from, how can we tell?</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I think I know that handwriting well.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Healthy Bunny got up and peeped
over her shoulder, saying,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“This letter’s addressed to Father Bun;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">It was not meant for every one.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny asked politely,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Let’s open the letter, then we’ll see</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">What it contains of mystery.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Surely, this little Bunny is wise;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The letter may have in it a surprise.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Father Bun took a knife, slit open
the envelope and looked at once at the
end of the sheet to see whom it was from.
It was signed, “Bunny Etiquette.” The
letter read,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“Bunnyville, March 9th, 1921.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Dear Brother Bun:</p>

<p>It is chilly this spring and the wind
blows round my cottage, and I need
some one to bring in wood and water
and cheer me up.</p>

<p>I am writing to ask if you could spare
Pretty Bunny to come and make me a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
visit. I am lonesome and I often think
I can hear the “pitter-patter” of little
feet on the stairs.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="13" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/13.jpg" alt="young bunny reading to parents">
</figure>
<br>

<p>I am sending by express a warm cap
and pair of mittens for each of the
Bunnies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>Write me soon. With kind regards to
Old Mother Bun,</p>

<p>Your affectionate sister,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
Edna Etiquette.”<br>
</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Pretty Bunny said, “May I go, Mother?
May I go, Father? May I start at once?”</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny said, “May I go, too?
May I go, too?”</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny turned to him and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Healthy Bunny, it is not polite</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Your own self ever to invite.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Healthy Bunny hung his head, for
sure enough, Aunt Etiquette had only
asked Pretty Bunny to come for a visit.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny then said again, “Oh
Father and Mother, may I please go?”</p>

<p>To this Old Father Bun replied,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You very seldom need to tease,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">When you use that small word ‘PLEASE.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So it was decided that Pretty Bunny
should go and visit Aunt Etiquette next
week, and such a hurrying and scurrying
as there was to get ready!</p>

<p>Up in the garret they went and
brought down Old Father Bun’s suit case
and began to pack it full of clothes for
Pretty Bunny. They never once
imagined that at that very minute, up
in another garret, another Bunny was
packing a suit case that looked exactly
like this one.</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny looked sad for he
wanted to go too.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without any warning, Old
Father Bun clapped his paws and
shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I think of little things like these,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">We should reply, if you please.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sure enough, at the end of Aunt
Etiquette’s letter they found the letters,
“R. S. V. P.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="16" style="max-width: 61.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/16.jpg" alt="two bunnies">
</figure>

<p>While these letters were usually put
only on a formal invitation to a party,
Aunt Etiquette had used them just for
fun to see if Pretty Bunny would know
that they stood for French words meaning,
“Reply, if you please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>Now, who was going to write the letter
in reply?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Said Old Father Bun, “Don’t you think we’d better</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sit right down to answer this kind letter?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then he went off in his cozy corner to
smoke.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Said Old Mother Bun, “It makes me sigh,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Every letter really needs a reply.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then she went off to make apple dumplings!</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I hope some one will not forget</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To write to Old Aunt Etiquette.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then he went out to take exercise and
Pretty Bunny was left to answer the letter,
of course.</p>

<p>She drew up a stool beside Old Father
Bun and said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I will write the answer now, to-day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">But, Old Father Bun, what shall I say?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Father Bun smoked a while in silence
collecting his thoughts and then
replied,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pretty Bunny, now, let us hope</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">You know how to address an envelope.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny did not know, for she
had never addressed an envelope in all
her life.</p>

<p>Said Old Father Bun kindly,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pretty Bunny, notice, as you’re bright,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Address each line farther to the right.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the envelope was addressed it
looked like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Miss Edna Etiquette,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">106 Wood Avenue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Bunnyville,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Wisconsin.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Father Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Put a comma after each line but one;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Place a period then when you are done.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>
<p>Pretty Bunny said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Father Bun, had I not better</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Buy a stamp to carry the letter?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Father Bun looked in his coat
pocket and after quite a search found a
postage stamp. He remarked,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Right side up you will agree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">On the right hand corner a stamp you see.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, do you know Pretty Bunny put
the stamp on the right hand corner of
the envelope, but she put it on the lower
right hand corner, instead of on the upper
right hand corner, by mistake, and
so she had to soak off the stamp and
paste it later in its proper place.</p>

<p>She was now ready to write her letter.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Old Father Bun said, “Now, I guess,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At the top, to the right, put your address.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So Pretty Bunny wrote,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p class="right">
“Woodville, Wisconsin,<br>
<span style="padding-right: 1em">March 10th, 1921.</span></p>
<p class="no-indent">
My dear Aunt Etiquette,<br>
</p>

<p>We received your letter with its kind
invitation and Mother and Father say I
may go to visit you soon.</p>

<p>I can hardly wait for the time to
come, and Healthy Bunny and I are
anxious to receive the pretty things you
are sending us.</p>

<p>Father Bunny says he will bring me
to your home on Friday.</p>

<p>I hope you are real well, and I will
be very happy to come and keep you
company and do any errands I can for
you.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="padding-right: 2em">Your loving niece,</span><br>
Pretty Bunny.<br>
</p>

<p>P. S. I wonder if you really did hear
‘pitter, patter’ of little feet on the
stairs, or could it have been what we call
‘imagination’?”</p>

<p>Old Father Bun said this was a very
good letter for it answered Aunt Etiquette’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
questions and told her what she
wanted to know.</p>

<p>Old Father Bun had just finished his
pipe when Old Mother Bun called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Dinner is ready for every one;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">My dumplings, too, are exactly done.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny went out to call Healthy
Bunny and just then the expressman
came with the caps and mittens.</p>

<p>Of course, the Bunnies had to try them
on at once.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Mother Bun said, “I don’t mean to scold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But my dinner will all get cold.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She might have added that it shows
very bad manners to be late to meals
if we can possibly help it.</p>

<p>The Bunnies took off their new things
and came to dinner. Said Pretty Bunny,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Excuse us, Mother, we just had to wait;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To dinner we do not mean to be late.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That night after they had all gone to
bed, Pretty Bunny began to wonder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
about the “pitter, patter” of foot-steps
on Aunt Etiquette’s stair-case.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="22" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/22.jpg" alt="two bunnies in bed">
</figure>

<p>She wondered if there really was another
Bunny in the house.</p>

<p>Said the Old Family Clock in reply,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I knew once, but I forget,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I lived long ago with Aunt Etiquette.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny crept out of bed and
pressed her face close to the Old Family
Clock and whispered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent1">If a Bunnie travels on the stairs.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Old Family Clock ticked in the
usual way for some time and then sang,</p>

PRETTY BUNNY’S JOURNEY</h2>

    <div class="verse indent0">Pretty Bunny should refrain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From eating peanuts on the train;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She should not stare at any one,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So says good Old Father Bun.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The day for the journey came at last
and Old Father Bun and Pretty Bunny
waved their paws and cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Good bye, good bye, we are happy, you know;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Good bye, good bye, on a journey we go.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They went briskly along until they
came to town, and stood on the right side
of the street watching for a street car.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny was so excited, she
waved her red pocket handkerchief with
the white spots in it at the street car
conductor, and Old Father Bun said he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
was surprised to find she had such poor
manners, but as she had never seen a
street car before, of course, she did not
know how to behave.</p>

<p>What a crowded car it was!</p>

<p>Old Father Bun said, “Wait ’till the
car stops to get on board.” He was particular
to have the fare ready so the conductor
did not have to wait. He told
Pretty Bunny, in some street cars you
had to pay as you enter, and in some the
conductor came to get the fares.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny began to stare at the
passengers for they were so interesting,
but Old Father Bun remarked quietly,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Good manners help us everywhere,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And one should never rudely stare.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One passenger in particular interested
Pretty Bunny.</p>

<p>He sat beside her and began to talk in
a most familiar manner. He said his
name was Bunny Brag, and he was going
on a long journey. He said he had his
Father’s old suit case to carry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="26" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/26.jpg" alt="bunnie with wings">
</figure>

<p>Pretty Bunny was so interested talking
that she would have gone on past her
crossing if Father Bun had not been
looking out for her and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You can have good manners if you choose;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">You had better mind your P’s and Q’s.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He meant that Pretty Bunny had better
pay attention when the car stopped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
and be ready to get off, and he also
wanted to remind her not to talk to
strangers.</p>

<p>Said Father Bun pleasantly,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You are starting on a real vacation,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And here we are at the Railroad Station.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny noticed a group of Bunnies
who were talking loudly in the station
and Old Father Bun remarked to
her,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Those Bunnies ought to hide their faces,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">They have no business in public places.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He went to get their tickets and check
their suit-case, then they got aboard the
train.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny was so excited she cried,
“Where shall we sit? May I take a seat
next the window? Are all the seats reserved?
How soon will we start?” She
was so noisy that several passengers
turned and stared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>Old Father Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pretty Bunny, let me explain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">We should have good manners on the train;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Let no one know where you wish to go,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And always speak in a voice quite low.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny was sorry she had made
enough noise to attract the attention of
other people, so she sat very still until
the train started.</p>

<p>She began to think of her visit to Aunt
Etiquette and wondered who the strange
Rabbit could be who went so quietly on
the stairs. She thought that the wheels
suddenly said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Up the stairs, up the stairs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Nobody cares, nobody cares.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was at this very minute that Old
Father Bun asked Pretty Bunny if she
could take care of the check for her
suit-case.</p>

<p>Of course, Pretty Bunny said, “Yes,”
and Old Father Bun added,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Let me mention this again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Don’t talk to strangers on the train.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In a few minutes, Pretty Bunny felt
a tap on her back. There stood Bunny
Brag who had come on the same train
without their noticing him. As Pretty
Bunny had talked with him in the street
car, somehow she did not look upon him
as a stranger.</p>

<p>Bunny Brag sat down in the seat beside
her and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I have a check for my suit-case, too;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I tied mine with a ribbon blue.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He felt in his pocket and found a piece
of blue ribbon and tied it on Pretty
Bunny’s check. Every once in a while
they exchanged checks just for fun, and
soon they had them so mixed up they
did not know which really belonged to
them. Bunny Brag said it made no difference
any way, the checks looked just
alike. They did not compare the numbers
on them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="30" style="max-width: 38.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/30.jpg" alt="mother bunny carrying bunny and father">
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>Bunny Brag said he was going on a
long journey but he knew how to take
care of himself for he had been in the
cars before. He bragged a great deal
about his trip.</p>

<p>He offered Pretty Bunny some peanuts
and when Old Father Bun returned
he found peanut shells on the floor and
car seat.</p>

<p>He made the two little Bunnies pick
them up and asked Bunny Brag to give
him his seat. He then said to Pretty
Bunny,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I thought I told you this before,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Don’t throw things upon the floor;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">If anything you have to eat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Always keep the car-seat neat.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He saw that Pretty Bunny had her
check on a ribbon round her neck and
thought no more about the matter.</p>

<p>Bunny Brag ran up and down the aisle
for a drink of water.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny said, “May I get a drink
of water, too?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="32" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/32.jpg" alt="bunny in front of mirror">
</figure>

<p>Old Father Bun replied,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Can’t you really wait until</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">We arrive at Bunnyville?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He took out his little watch and said
they would get to their journey’s end in
half an hour.</p>

<p>The little silver watch was a magic
watch and as Old Father Bun held it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
up to Pretty Bunny’s ear it said, as it
ticked merrily along,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here is a true saying, do not doubt it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">You’re not thirsty unless you think about it.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Father Bun continued it was a
great annoyance for youngsters to always
want a drink of water when they
were away from home.</p>

<p>In a short time they arrived at Bunnyville.</p>

<p>They waited until the train stopped to
get off and Old Father Bun helped
Pretty Bunny down as she was so little.
Then he took the check from the
ribbon round her neck and got the suit-case
and they tripped off merrily to Aunt
Etiquette’s home.</p>

<p>When they arrived, there stood Aunt
Etiquette in the door-way. She kissed
them both and they soon sat down to
dinner.</p>

<p>Old Father Bun said he must catch
the next train home, so he soon bade
Aunt Etiquette good bye, and Pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
Bunny stood and waved at him as long
as he was in sight.</p>

<p>Then she said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Aunt Etiquette, what is the matter?</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I don’t hear your Bunny ‘pitter, patter’.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, Aunt Etiquette had beautiful
manners, but when she did not want to
answer a question she pretended she
did not hear, so she often made an odd
reply. Now she said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We will go up stairs, never fear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And unpack your suit-case, dear.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Up the mysterious stair-case they
went, and each board creaked after
them, for the house was very old, and
Pretty Bunny did think she heard some
one else beside Aunt Etiquette behind
her, but as she turned she saw no other
Bunny.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny unlocked the suit case
and took out the first garment. It was
such a suit as Healthy Bunny would
wear. As they kept on unpacking it
grew worse and worse; there was not a
thing for a Bunny Girl to wear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="35" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/35.jpg" alt="bunny next to cabinet">
</figure>

<p>Pretty Bunny sat down and cried.</p>

<p>Old Aunt Etiquette said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pretty Bunny, please explain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Did you exchange checks on the train?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Aunt Etiquette thought of this, for
she had once done the same thing when
she was a little girl. Then Pretty Bunny
explained the whole matter, and Aunt
Etiquette said they would try to find
Bunny Brag for he had her suit-case, of
course!</p>

<p>Aunt Etiquette was a cheerful person
and remarked,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We will learn from a mistake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Another one we will not make.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Aunt Etiquette then explained that it
was important to keep your own ticket
and check on a train, and that though
the checks looked alike they had different
numbers upon them and each check
belonged to its own suit-case.</p>

<p>When bed time came, Aunt Etiquette
tucked Pretty Bunny up in one of her
own nighties, though it was miles too
big, and she kissed her, saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Trouble now we will not borrow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I’ll make you a dress to-morrow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Aunt Etiquette went down stairs
to read the evening paper, and Pretty
Bunny tried to remember some of the
things she had learned on her trip.</p>

<p>She wondered if she would hear the
“pitter, patter” again on the stairs.</p>

<p>The Old Grandfather Clock ticked
away, singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Our big front door we always lock,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Tick, tock, tick, tock.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>
<p>Pretty Bunny felt quite at home when
she heard the kindly Old Grandfather
Clock talking right outside her door, so
she said sleepily,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’ll say my lesson over again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">We should not eat peanuts on the train;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And if for manners we really care,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">At strangers we will not rudely stare;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And we can remember to speak low,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">When on a journey we have to go.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Whether we have to ride or walk,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">This lesson I hope you’ve learned before,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Please don’t throw things upon the floor;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">If you’re a well-mannered son or daughter,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">You’ll not ALWAYS ask for a drink of water;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To sum up these jingles as a whole,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Have you learned the lesson of Self-control?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Old Grandfather Clock enjoyed
that very much and sang,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Your advice is good but it sounds funny;</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">Tick, tock, tick, tock.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Before Pretty Bunny could think up
another jingle she fell fast asleep.</p>

THE BED-ROOM BUNNY</h2>
</div>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent0">This Bed-Room belongs to Aunt Etiquette,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">You can put it in order and pick up clothes?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny woke early next morning
and sprang out of bed and looked in
the mirror. She saw another Bunny
just her size and called, “Who are you?”
The other Bunny replied,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Said the Looking-Glass Bunny, ‘it’s funny but true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The more you see me, the more I see you.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny nodded her head and
the Looking-Glass Bunny did the same.</p>

<p>“How many Bunnies live in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
house?” asked Pretty Bunny. The Looking-Glass
Bunny answered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I can’t count, though you think it funny;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Perhaps you will meet the Shadow Bunny.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was very early, and Pretty Bunny
was beginning to feel a little homesick
when the Looking-Glass Bunny said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pretty Bunny, you should rejoice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Everything in this room has a voice.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Right then and there, there was a
humming sound and a voice from the
window called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pretty Bunny, don’t you care</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">About letting in fresh air?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny had forgotten to open
the window.</p>

<p>My! How close and stuffy the room
was!</p>

<p>She ran now and opened the window
and was wondering what to do next to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
put the bed-room in order when a voice
called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here is the foot, and here is the head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Do you know the way to make a bed?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The pillows danced round in the most
comical manner and sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pretty Bunny, if you are bright,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">You will enjoy a pillow fight.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>My! that was a difficult bed to make!
But in the course of time Pretty Bunny
had aired the bedding and made the bed
up neatly with the pillows at the head.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny next enjoyed a cold
bath and never for a minute thought to
pick up anything until a voice cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Said the pitcher, ‘I’ve heard such things before,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Careless people leave me on the floor.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny picked up the pitcher to
set on the wash stand when, to her surprise,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The wash bowl said, “Just listen a minute,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why leave the bowl full, with water in it?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny emptied the water out
of the bowl, dried it and set the pitcher
neatly in it.</p>

<p>Towels were on the floor and towels
were on a chair.</p>

<p>To her surprise Pretty Bunny heard a
voice say,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pretty Bunny, have you the knack</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Of hanging towels upon a rack?”</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Then in a voice that scolded,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">She said, “Is each towel folded?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny laughed as she folded
the towels and put them on the rack.
She was ready to dance down stairs when
a voice cried out,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Though a maid is really the bed-room keeper,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">You might plan to use the carpet sweeper.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>
<p>Pretty Bunny found the carpet
sweeper and ran it over the rug where
she had gotten lint from the towels. She
then dusted the room and was just ready
when Aunt Etiquette rang the bell for
breakfast.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny said, “Good morning, I
hope you slept well, Aunt Etiquette,”
and she kissed her on both cheeks, remarking,
all in one breath, as little Bunnies
do,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“How many Bunnies live with you?</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Tell me, Aunt Etiquette, please do.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Aunt Etiquette replied,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Speak a little louder, dear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">So Aunt Etiquette can hear.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Try hard as she would, Pretty Bunny
could not make Aunt Etiquette understand
a word of what she said!</p>

<p>They had a happy day together and
when night came the most surprising
thing happened!</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny heard the “pitter, patter”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
of little feet behind her as she went
up stairs. Turning again, she could see
no one. As usual, she threw her clothes
on the floor and heard a merry voice
say,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For Bed-Room Manners if you care,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Fold your clothes up on a chair.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny always minded, for
minding is a part of good manners, so
she sprang out of bed and folded her
clothes neatly on a chair.</p>

<p>She hopped back into bed, and to her
surprise saw a little Bunny sitting on
one of the bed posts. He said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Myself I’ll introduce to you;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I’m the Bed-Room Bunny, how do you do?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny bowed politely and the
Bed-Room Bunny continued,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You can learn manners if you choose;</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny had left her shoes on
the floor where any one might stumble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
over them. She got up now and put
them under the chair by her clothes,
saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I learn Bed-Room manners by day and night;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I really like to be called polite.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Bed-Room Bunny answered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Open your window, open it wide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">If you really must sleep inside.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny got up and opened her
window wide, and before she had time
to ask how many Bunnies lived in the
house, she had fallen asleep and was
dreaming that every room in the house
needed to be put in order. She heard a
voice call,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’m the Good Mannered Bunny, I sing, and sing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">We should have a place for everything.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Next morning Pretty Bunny took
pride in picking up her room, and she
asked to do the same for Aunt Etiquette
who was old and stiff and lame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>Aunt Etiquette was glad of a little
help but remarked,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Bed-Room Manners taught me long ago</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Said, ‘Air your bed for an hour or so’.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny learned to leave the
beds airing and made them up later in
the day. She helped Aunt Etiquette all
day long and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I have met the Bed-Room Bunny,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I don’t see him often, it is funny;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And I would give a mint of money,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">If I could play with Looking-Glass Bunny.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Looking-Glass Bunny would not
step over the mirror frame, though
Pretty Bunny tried to coax him to come
out and play.</p>

<p>One day Pretty Bunny tacked some
pictures up on the wall and the Bed-Room
Bunny peeped out from an open bureau
drawer and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Don’t you hear me really scolding?</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Hang pictures only from the moulding.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>
<p>Sure enough, there was picture
moulding all around the room.</p>

<p>There were plenty of hooks to hang
pictures on and it did seem a shame to
drive tacks in the wall.</p>

<p>The Bed-Room Bunny also remarked,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A bureau drawer, as I suppose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Is really meant to open and CLOSE.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He shouted the word “CLOSE”, for
every bureau drawer was open a little
and it gave the room an untidy appearance.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny closed up the bureau
drawers and went about dancing and
singing a happy little song,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Bed-Room Manners if you please,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Tell us many things like these,</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">And before you are quite through</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">A duster we’ll introduce to you;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">These rules we think you’ll not forget,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">They make up Bed-Room Etiquette.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

</figure>

<p>All this time no word had come from
Bunny Brag and the lost suit case. Many
times Pretty Bunny wondered how he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
felt when he opened her suit case and
found it filled with dresses.</p>

<p>Late that night Pretty Bunny heard
the “patter, patter” of little feet, and
called, “Who is there?” A voice
answered, “Who is there?” Pretty Bunny
continued, “That is not fair,” and the
voice answered, “not fair.”</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny wondered more and
more who was the Bunny who was repeating
everything she said.</p>

<p>She said to herself, “I love this old
house and everything in it, and to-morrow
I will just sit out there on the stairs
and try to catch the Bunny who goes
‘pitter patter,’ but now I will say (and
she spoke out loud) Good night and
pleasant dreams.”</p>

<p>A sweet voice answered, “Pleasant
dreams.”</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Next day Pretty Bunny put her room
in order and went hoppety skip down
stairs, and straight to the breakfast
table.</p>

<p>She started to slip into her chair,
when to her surprise the chair said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To learn some manners it is best,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Do not sit down before the rest.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny said, “This is the most
wonderful house I was ever in for even
the furniture talks to me.”</p>

<p>Just then Aunt Etiquette came in
with a steaming cup of coffee. Pretty
Bunny pulled out a chair for her and
waited to sit down until she was seated
and said a pleasant “Good morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She said, “I do like cakes and honey;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where’s my friend, the Bed-Room Bunny?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Aunt Etiquette smiled and said
quite as though she had not heard this
question,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pretty Bunny, are you able</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To keep your elbows off the table?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny blushed rosy red, unfolded
her napkin and sat very straight.
When helped to coffee, cakes and honey,
she began to eat rather noisily and Aunt
Etiquette said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Bunnies, as well as girls and boys,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Can eat their meals with little noise.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny said, “How I do love
to learn lessons by saying jingles over
and over, for the funny little rhymes I
can’t forget, and they make me remember
useful things.”</p>

<p>Just then a crash was heard and
Pretty Bunny was so excited she left the
table without stopping to say, “Excuse
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>She ran up stairs and found the mirror
in her room had fallen and broken into
many pieces. She looked all about
for the Looking-Glass Bunny but caught
only a glimpse of her long ears, and
though she called him again and again
she received no answer.</p>

<p>Aunt Etiquette called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Perhaps the mirror can be mended;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Do not leave the meal ’till it is ended.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny slipped back into her
place at the table and said, “Please excuse
me, Aunt Etiquette, I was so excited
by the noise.” Aunt Etiquette answered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Manners at table, manners at table</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">You can learn for you’re plenty able.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny said, “Please teach me
good table manners, Aunt Etiquette, so
I will never be ashamed.”</p>

<p>Aunt Etiquette then said a magic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
verse and everything on the table received
a voice and one thing after another
began to talk.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="53" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent1">Said the pretty silver knife,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’ve had troubles all my life;</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">Tell it in rhyme, tell it in song.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>
<p>Pretty Bunny used her knife to cut
butter with, which was perfectly proper,
and she ate her food neatly with her fork
and spoon. Then a new voice piped up,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I will teach a lesson very soon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Eat from the side of your spoon.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The spoon went on telling about
some people who will take soup the
wrong way, putting the point of the
spoon into the mouth instead of sipping
it from the side.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny twisted round a good
deal in her chair until the chair said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You’re a restless Bunny, I declare;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Try to sit still in your chair.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She dropped some crumbs on the
floor and the rug under her feet sang
out,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Good manners require one thing more,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Don’t drop crumbs upon the floor.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny was excited to hear
all these voices and she was very hungry,
too, so she said, “Give me coffee, please.
May I have more honey?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>The honey pitcher remarked sweetly,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Wait ’till food is passed to you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">As a well mannered Bunny would do.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny said, “Aunt Etiquette,
there are so many things to learn, I do
wonder what broke the mirror?”</p>

<p>Aunt Etiquette said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The cord was broken once before;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I think it fell upon the floor.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny was still hungry and
started to take two cookies at a time to
finish up her breakfast and the cookie
plate called out,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If you can learn a simple rhyme,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Take just one thing at a time.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny put one cookie back
on the plate. Now, as she was not always
careful to chew with her mouth
closed, Aunt Etiquette remarked,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To be well mannered ’tis supposed</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To eat your food with mouth well closed.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>
<p>Pretty Bunny began to drum upon
the plate and the table said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Bunny, ’tis a sad mistake</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Drumming noises now to make.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny finished breakfast.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now, I am happy to relate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her knife and fork lay on her plate</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">She put her napkin in the ring.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Just as Pretty Bunny said, “Aunt
Etiquette, may I be excused from the
table?” “Ting-a-ling,” rang the door
bell, and Pretty Bunny went to answer.</p>

<p>There to her surprise stood Homeless
Bunny, and Happy Bunny, and
Healthy Bunny and Heedless Bunny;
they had come on a hike all the way.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny bowed to her visitors
and asked them in and introduced them
one at a time to Aunt Etiquette.</p>

<p>Aunt Etiquette said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You are welcome to stay a year and day;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">You may attend school just down the way.”</div>

<p>“School!” said Homeless Bunny.</p>

<p>“School!” said Happy Bunny.</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny asked, “Is it schooltime?”</p>

<p>Heedless Bunny said, “Would we
really have to go to school?”</p>

<p>Aunt Etiquette answered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“School is in session, as a rule;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Fine manners you can learn in school.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then, without a word of warning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
instantly and in a moment of time, Heedless
Bunny turned a somersault and ran
off as fast as his legs could carry him.</p>

<p>Happy Bunny said, “If you will
excuse me, Aunt Etiquette, I will hurry
homeward.” Heedless Bunny said,
“Good bye,” and so you see only Healthy
Bunny was willing to stay and go to
school.</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny and Pretty Bunny
talked after they had gone to bed that
night and Pretty Bunny said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You can learn, if you are able,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Very good manners at the table;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Perhaps you’ve heard me say before,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Don’t drop crumbs upon the floor;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Use your knife to butter bread,</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">To fold your napkin you are able,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And say “Excuse me from the table.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny’s head went nid-nid,
nodding, and she was soon fast asleep,
but Healthy Bunny heard the “patter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
patter, patter,” of little feet upon the
stairs. He wondered if it could be
Bunny Brag coming with the suit case.</p>

<p>He ran out in the hall and saw no
one, so he said “I must have fallen asleep
and been dreaming after all. I wish I
could see the Looking-Glass Bunny, but
I suppose he broke the mirror and ran
away.”</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny crept down into the
hall and danced before the mirror and
there he saw the Looking-Glass Bunny
dancing merrily. He asked the Looking-Glass
Bunny who went “pitter, patter,” on
the stairs, but the Looking-Glass Bunny
only nodded and smiled and danced, and
did not answer a word for sixteen minutes,
then he whispered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I could tell you, if I choose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">But you’d scatter far and wide the news.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Healthy Bunny laughed and went
back to bed, for the Looking-Glass Bunny
could keep some secrets after all.</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny dreamed that he sat
at table with Aunt Etiquette and sang
to the tune of “Twinkle Little Star,”</p>

    <div class="verse indent1">To sit straight up in your chair.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Next morning at breakfast Healthy
Bunny asked if he might repeat the
song.</p>

<p>Aunt Etiquette said, “Yes,” and
added,</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny said, “I will go back

<p>Pretty Bunny began to feel a little

<p>Pretty Bunny turned around and
saw Shadow Bunny behind her. She
laughed at his long ears, but he said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Pretty Bunny hopped along and said
to herself, “I feel rather strange for this
will be my first day in the new school.
I wonder if Bunny Brag may possibly
come to this school.”</p>

<p>Bunny Brag did not appear at school,
and Pretty Bunny did not meet him for
days and days.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny looked around when
she came to the door of the school;
Shadow Bunny had disappeared.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny hesitated a minute,
but the Bunnies in Miss Manner’s school
were very polite. They told Pretty
Bunny where to hang her wraps and her
dinner-pail, and made her feel quite at
home. As it was not yet time for school
to begin, the Bunnies went and cleaned
the blackboard and erasers and hung up
all the erasers neatly on the hooks.
They said,</p>

<p>The teacher came in with a pleasant
“Good Morning.”</p>

<p>She read a story that day that every
one liked. The story was called, “Little
Rag-Tag.”</p>

<p>“Once upon a time, Little Rag-Tag
came to school. She had on a ragged

<p>Little Miss Brag said, “Look at her

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>They made so much fun of her that
it made Little Rag-Tag very unhappy.</p>

<p>I don’t know what she would have
done but Little Miss Shy came and

<p>Little Miss Brag and Thoughtless
Tom were sorry they had been unkind
and Little Miss Shy said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In school there are so very many,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">What if each one gave a penny?</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">We can remember, if we try,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And a new dress we can buy.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The pennies came thick and fast
and they helped to buy a dress all ready
made for Little Rag-Tag, and the next
time she came to school she had on the
new dress, and her shoes were neatly
buttoned, and she said “I love every one.”</p>

<p>A little kindness had made her all
smiles and sunshine.</p>

<p>The Bunnies liked this story so well
that for three whole days they remembered
not to make fun of any one as a
lesson in manners and a lesson in kindness.</p>

<p>Next day, when Pretty Bunny got
to school, she saw some of the Bunnies
in a group laughing at some joke they
did not explain to the others. She said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Good mannered Bunnies have a care</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Their jokes with every one to share.”</div>

  <img class="w100" src="images/67.jpg" alt="bunnies in school">
</figure>

<p>The Bunnies in this school did really
want to learn good manners, so now they
shared their joke with Pretty Bunny.</p>

<p>Then Pretty Bunny said, “I know a
joke, too.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Yesterday, ’twas really funny,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I came to school with Shadow Bunny;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I thought to-day we’d run a race,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>
<p>The Bunnies said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Shadow Bunny is full of fun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">But only comes out with the sun.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The day was cloudy, and Pretty
Bunny said, “How much there is to learn
in school, and out,” and the School Room
Clock quite agreed with her, for by and
by, when the Bunnies were asking to borrow
pencils and erasers and rulers, the
School Room Clock sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Provide yourselves with things to-morrow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Then you will not have to borrow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some of the Bunnies whispered and
the School Room Clock ticked loudly and
said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Good manners you must learn again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">From whispering then please refrain.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some of the Bunnies had to look in
the dictionary to see what the last word
meant. Do you?</p>

<p>They all became so still in school
they could hear the Clock ticking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>That day so many children wanted
to go out for a drink of water and so
many children asked needless questions
that Miss Manners said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Self-control is a mighty task;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Think before some things you ask.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the Bunnies stopped to think
they found many questions they asked
were needless. The Clock talked again,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Do not shuffle with your feet;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Keep the aisles about you neat.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It continued,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Don’t snap your fingers; observe the rule</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Be polite all day in school.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Miss Manners taught them all to
play games and reminded them to be
honest. She said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Take your turn, perhaps you’ll beat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">No one can endure a cheat.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some Bunnies wanted to break into
a game already started and some of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
boasted they could run faster than any
one else. Miss Manners said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We’ll make a good-mannered poster;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">No one ever loves a boaster.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She continued to say that we should
be willing to take our turn in playing a
game and be good-natured whether we
won or not.</p>

<p>Tattle-Tale Bunny stood in the corner
of the play-ground talking to a new
Bunny, and Miss Manners called him to
her quietly and said that we should not
repeat tales to any one, even after school;
the only ones safe to confide in were the
teacher, or one’s own mother.</p>

<p>When the recess games were over
the Bunnies came trooping in, still noisy
and out of breath. Then the teacher
gave them a “Sitting Lesson.” They had
to fold their paws and sit so still they
could hear the Clock tick.</p>

<p>Miss Manners had them write, as a
lesson, something to remember after
school. They wrote,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We will not linger about to play,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">We will go home from school each day.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>
<p>If Pretty Bunny had followed this
advice she would not have met with misfortune.
As it was, she hung around the
school grounds some time and then went
loitering along, singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When I grow up I’ll keep each rule,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And have good manners each day in school;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I’ll take two pencils, so I’ll not borrow</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">One from my seat-mate, to-day or to-morrow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I will not whisper, you understand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And quietly I’ll raise my hand;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I’ll keep my desk and aisle so neat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And not make noises with my feet;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">On the play ground every day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I will stand up for fair play;”</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Pretty Bunny behaved well as a rule</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">But went on singing, “Manners in School.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She went on humming until some one
said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here you are, my run-a-way;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I’ve looked for you most all day.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny looked around and before
she could say a word a large Bunny
was leading her off.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny said to the strange
Bunny, “I am sure you are mistaken; I
am on my way home from school.”</p>

<p>The stranger Bunny said, “Ha, ha, ha,
so you think you can fool me again; indeed,
I have never had such a search
in all my life.”</p>

<p>The strange Bunny was very near-sighted,
and she really did mistake
Pretty Bunny for her own run-away
Grandchild!</p>

<p>On they went until they came to the
grocery store, then in they went.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny was very hungry.</p>

<p>Are you ever hungry after school?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="73" style="max-width: 58.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/73.jpg" alt="bunnies at store">
</figure>

<p>She picked up a few peanuts that were
in a box on the counter, really without
thinking, and the strange Bunny boxed
her ears, saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Your ways seem very rude and funny;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Don’t help yourself, but pay your money.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>
<p>Another Bunny was ordering of another
clerk and kept asking questions
and said the prices were much too high
and talked so as to take up all the clerk’s
time.</p>

<p>The strange Bunny asked Pretty
Bunny if she had noticed this after they
had left the store, and remarked,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To be well-mannered I hope you’ll try;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Don’t handle things unless you buy.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny said, “Let me go home,
please let me go home; you have made
a mistake, I am not your grandchild at
all, I am visiting Aunt Etiquette.”</p>

<p>The strange Bunny went hurrying on
as though nothing had been said. They
went into a house at last and the door
latched behind them.</p>

<p>The strange Bunny looked at Pretty
Bunny very hard and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I think perhaps I have been tricked</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">But it is not your business to contradict.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>
<p>She went on to say we should be very
careful about disputing with our elders;
even if we feel sure we are right, we
should say politely, “I think it was this
way.”</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny sat down and cried.</p>

<p>The stranger Bunny said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We should try, in all times and places,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To be cheerful, with smiling faces;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">You don’t know some things I suspect;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To older people show respect.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Pretty Bunny got up and bowed
low and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I did not really want to come;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Let me go home, let me go home.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The strange Bunny said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A little Bunny should not tease,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">But use words like ‘If you please’.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After this, the strange Bunny began
to act wild and said “Who broke my
water pitcher this morning? and who hid
my coal scuttle? Who ran off with my
big cabbage?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>Now Pretty Bunny wished for the
hundredth time she had gone right
home from school and truly she did not
know what to do, for she had done none
of these things, and I don’t know what in
the world would have happened if the
Run Away Bunny had not come bounding
in at that very moment.</p>

<p>He said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am hungry, I want honey,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I am back, Run Away Bunny.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The strange Bunny put on her best
spectacles and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I did make a mistake I see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">But Bunnies look alike to me.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For all that, she would not let Pretty
Bunny go home in the dark, for evening
had come.</p>

<p>Run Away Bunny was very impolite
and called the strange Bunny by her first
name.</p>

<p>She boxed his ears and said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I have told you before, it is a shame</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To call an older person by their first name.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny said, “I learned another
lesson one day in politeness. Shall I tell
it to you?”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We should not laugh at a story we tell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Not even if we relate it well.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The strange Bunny asked her grandchild
for another ball of yarn, for she
was busily knitting. She was surprised
to have it tossed to her from across the
room.</p>

<p>She said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Do not toss things, that’s rarely done;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Always hand them, please, to every one.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Just then she remembered she was
thirsty and asked Pretty Bunny to go and
get her a pitcher of water, which pretty
Bunny was glad to do, of course, but she
handed her the pitcher in the wrong manner,
still holding onto the handle herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>Said the strange Bunny,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Some manners you have learned I see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">But the handle please turn toward me.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She continued by saying that we should
always pass an article to another with
the handle toward them; that was the
correct thing to do.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny said, “I am afraid Aunt
Etiquette will be looking for me at
home.”</p>

<p>The strange Bunny said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“She will worry, I do not doubt it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">But what can we really do about it?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny said she was not afraid
of the dark and was anxious to get back
to Aunt Etiquette, but the strange Bunny
said, “It is not safe for youngsters to be
out late,” so they sat for an hour and
ten minutes thinking over the matter.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The strange Bunny said, “This thing I’ll do,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will walk on home to-night with you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No sooner said than done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>The Run Away Bunny was left to keep
house, and the other went off in the
dark, the strange Bunny saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I learned, before I grew so old,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To always do as I was told.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny replied,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I really meant to keep the rule,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And not linger after school.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>
<p>A light shone from Aunt Etiquette’s
door-way.</p>

<p>She stood in her own door-way, and as
they drew near they heard her say,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Where, oh, where, is Pretty Bunny?</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I wouldn’t lose her for a mint of money.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Several Bunnies crowded round Aunt
Etiquette.</p>

<p>Said Homeless Bunny, “I hear foot-steps.”</p>

<p>Said Heedless Bunny, “Perhaps she is
coming home.”</p>

<p>Said Happy Bunny, “I think I hear her
voice.”</p>

<p>Said Healthy Bunny, “Here come two
Bunnies down the road, clippety, clippety,
clip.”</p>

<p>Sure enough the strange Bunny and
Pretty Bunny were coming nearer every
minute, and in less time than it takes
to tell it Pretty Bunny was in Aunt Etiquette’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
arms and the strange Bunny came
inside and had a cup of tea and
said,</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="81" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/81.jpg" alt="bunnies in heart">

    <div class="verse indent0">“I am sorry I made this mistake;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Very good tea, indeed, you make.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is polite to compliment a hostess on
her food and drink. The strange Bunny
said she was very near sighted and had
been looking for her Run-Away grandchild
all day. She was sorry, indeed, she
had made such a mistake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>Aunt Etiquette politely asked her visitor
to stay all night, but she declined and
asking Aunt Etiquette to call on her soon,
went homeward.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny said she learned more
about manners every day of her life.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She said, “I am learning more, and more,</div>

<p>Aunt Etiquette kissed Pretty Bunny
good night, and said,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“You are fortunate this time, it’s true;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">No telling what might have happened to you.”</div>

said to them all,</p>

<p>All the Bunnies, except Pretty Bunny,
were ready soon and in their hurry they
slid down the banisters. Pretty Bunny
stopped to put her room in order. This
took her so long the other Bunnies had
started on their way when she was
ready.</p>

<p>As her little feet went “pitter, patter”
down the stairs she heard another “pitter,
patter” behind her. She turned, but saw
no one. She ran out doors and none of
the Bunnies were in sight. She stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
by the side of the house and called, “Boo-Hoo.”
A voice answered, “Boo-Hoo.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="85" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/85.jpg" alt="two bunnies">

<p>Pretty Bunny cried excitedly, “Who
are you?” and the voice repeated, “Who
are you?”</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny said, “Are you the Bunny
who goes pitter, patter on the stairs?”
The voice answered, “On the stairs.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Pretty Bunny sat down and
laughed until she cried, and then she
said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Some things are surely very funny;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I think you are the Echo Bunny.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The voice replied, “Echo Bunny.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="86" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/86.jpg" alt="three bunnies">
</figure>

<p>Pretty Bunny said, “Good bye,” and
Echo Bunny, (for it was really he,)
answered, “Good bye.”</p>

<p>At this very minute Healthy Bunny
came back and said Aunt Etiquette had
just found out that Pretty Bunny had
been left behind.</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny and Pretty Bunny
bumped into several people on the walk
until Pretty Bunny remarked,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A little Bunny who is bright</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Will always turn out to the right.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>
<p>They noticed then that people turned
to the right and teams turned to the
right also.</p>

<p>By this time they had caught up
with the others and noticed Aunt Etiquette
bowing politely to people she met.</p>

<p>She said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“How many Bunnies noticed that?</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">How many Bunnies raised their hat?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She said gentlemen always raised their
hats when a lady they were walking with
spoke to any one.</p>

<p>Heedless Bunny tried to attract the
attention of a Bunny across the street
and Aunt Etiquette said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Speak when any one you meet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">But please don’t shout across the street.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Homeless Bunny said, “Should we always
wait for an older person to speak to
us?”</p>

<p>Aunt Etiquette replied,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You may learn street manners now;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To an older person first you’ll bow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>
<p>She said a young person may recognize
an older person first, and that it is right
to always be ready to speak to a person
you know.</p>

<p>“Where are we going to-day, Aunt
Etiquette?” asked Healthy Bunny.</p>

<p>Happy Bunny shouted, “Where?
where?” and they soon had a crowd around
them, they made so much noise.
When the crowd found there was nothing
the matter they went on their way.</p>

<p>Aunt Etiquette looked quite severe
and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“How many times must I repeat;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Don’t attract attention on the street.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Bunnies looked quite ashamed
and Pretty Bunny said very politely, in
a low voice, “Please tell us where we are
going, Aunt Etiquette.”</p>

<p>Aunt Etiquette answered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To the library to get a book;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">We will seek a cozy nook.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At this, Heedless Bunny said, “Oh, no,
please take us to the Park.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>Homeless Bunny said, “Please take us
to the restaurant.”</p>

<p>Happy Bunny said, “We can have a
good time most any place, but we have
to keep still in a library.”</p>

<p>There were so many of them Aunt
Etiquette had to say every little while,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Step behind another, lad and lass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Step behind to let another pass.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Heedless Bunny began to whistle and
sing, and the first thing the rest knew he
had gone off down a cross street.</p>

<p>Homeless Bunny did not learn good
manners easily so he stopped to talk to
a person on a street corner.</p>

<p>Happy Bunny took hold of Healthy
Bunny, but they took too much room that
way walking on the sidewalk, so Aunt
Etiquette remarked,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Happy Bunny, you mean no harm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">On the street don’t take another’s arm;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To properly walk, please don’t forget,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Is part of good street Etiquette;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Walk straight ahead, and I suppose</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">You learned long ago to turn out your toes.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="90" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/90.jpg" alt="bunnies dressed up">
</figure>

<p>Happy Bunny and Pretty Bunny looked
down to see if they were really turning
out their toes. They told Aunt Etiquette
that sometimes at home they practised
walking straight and tried to stand so
erect that they could walk about carrying
a book on their heads without letting
it drop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>They met some Bunnies who were
dressed gayly and by dress and manner
tried really to attract attention.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Aunt Etiquette said, “Need I mention?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We should never try to attract attention.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She continued,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am truly glad to see</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">That you keep step with me.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sure enough, they were all keeping
step.</p>

<p>Happy Bunny turned to look after a
group of Bunnies they had passed and
Aunt Etiquette said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Don’t turn to look back at those you meet;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Please observe good manners on the street;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And a youngster may be in danger,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">If he speaks to a beggar or stranger.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>By the time they had come to the library
Happy Bunny began to ask questions.
“What book are you looking for,
Aunt Etiquette?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>She smiled and answered. “I am looking
for a book of Home-Made Fairy
Tales.”</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny said, “Hurrah, hurrah.”</p>

<p>Aunt Etiquette said, “If you really
want to learn good manners you will do
some thinking. In a library people are
reading.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Though it is not quite like school,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Be very still—observe this rule.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Aunt Etiquette got the book she wanted
and they started homeward.</p>

<p>Happy Bunny went off by himself but
Healthy Bunny and Pretty Bunny went
on with Aunt Etiquette.</p>

<p>She gave the two cunning little Bunnies
a surprise.</p>

<p>She took them into a restaurant and let
them order ice cream and cake.</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny was in such a hurry
to taste his ice cream and Pretty Bunny
was in such a hurry to taste her cake
that they began to eat before Aunt Etiquette
had put on her gold rimmed spectacles,
and she said quietly,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To keep good manners at the table,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Just wait to start ’till all are able.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Bunnies now waited until Aunt
Etiquette was ready to eat too, and they
said they were glad to learn so many
little things in a pleasant way.</p>

<p>When they arrived home at last, Pretty
Bunny drew a picture of a side walk and
wrote below it every rule of street manners
she could remember.</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny made a little song and
sang it to the tune of “Twinkle Little
Star.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When you’re walking on the street,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Be polite to all you meet;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">When you’re grown you’ll not regret</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">That you learned street Etiquette.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Late that night Pretty Bunny told
Healthy Bunny about hearing Echo
Bunny speak.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She said, “I wonder if he cares</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That I hear him patter on the stairs.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Healthy Bunny did not answer; he was
already asleep.</p>

<p>Next day Aunt Etiquette called,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Come, be on time at the table;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To be prompt you are able.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then, Pretty Bunny and Healthy
Bunny knew that breakfast was ready,
and they went hoppety-skip down stairs.</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny did many useful things
for Old Aunt Etiquette. He helped her
put her house in order and Pretty Bunny
washed her dishes, but, sad to say, they
were so slow about the work that Pretty
Bunny was late to school. That evening
she had to stay in school to make up the
time she had missed, and as Healthy
Bunny was visiting school he had to wait
for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>When evening came Old Aunt Etiquette
put on her best spectacles and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Who was late, tell me pray?</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Who was right on time to-day?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To be late to school I’ll not form the habit;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I was a careless, forgetful Rabbit.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>
<p>Healthy Bunny said, “I am to blame
too, I suppose. I should have run to the
store to get your laundry soap long before
time for the store to close.”</p>

<p>Both the Bunnies begged Aunt Etiquette
to tell a story and she said, “I will
read you a story from the book I got at
the library yesterday. So she began to
read “An On-Time Tale.”</p>

<p>“Once upon a time Tardy Ted talked
to his father one evening, and his father
remarked,</p>

    <div class="verse indent1">To what else were you late to-day?”</div>

<p>Tardy Ted loved to talk to his father.</p>

<p>His father replied,</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If every one in the world was late,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">For hours and hours we’d have to wait,</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">And he may help us in a trice.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Whistling Wind had a word soon
with Ted’s father, and he whispered to
many people that Ted was to visit next
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Tardy Ted was late to bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Whistling Wind went on ahead.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The next day was Saturday and Tardy
Ted went to the Tailor to see if he had
repaired his best suit and put buttons
on it. The Tailor said, as though it was
a matter of no moment,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Alas, young man, I’m a little late;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I really think you’ll have to wait.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Tardy Ted went to the Shoemaker
who was mending his best shoes,
and the Shoemaker said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Alas, young man, I’m a little late;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I really think you’ll have to wait.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then he went to the store at the last
minute to buy a new neck tie, and as it
was time to close, the clerk said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Alas, young man, I’m a little late;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I really think you’ll have to wait.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tardy Ted went home looking very
serious for next day he had a special
piece to speak in Sunday School, and he
could hardly bear the thought of wearing
an old suit, and old shoes, and old
neck tie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="99" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/99.jpg" alt="bunny thinking">
</figure>

<p>Father said, “Too bad, too bad.” He
did not add that he had spoken to the
Whistling Wind about Tardy Ted’s habit
of being late. He did not say he had
asked the Whistling Wind to drop a word
to the Tailor, and Shoemaker, and Clerk,
to teach Tardy Ted a lesson.</p>

<p>Tardy Ted went out all by himself into
the woods and began to think how upsetting
it would be if everybody was late
everywhere with work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>It was at this very minute that he
heard the Fairy Shoemaker singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A rat-a-tat, tat, a rat-a-tat, too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I mend shoes and make them good as new.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tardy Ted looked all round but he
could not find the Fairy Shoemaker, but
he recited his troubles any way.</p>

<p>The Fairy Shoemaker said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A rat-a-tat, tat, a rat-a-tat, too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I could sew on a few buttons for you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Tardy Ted said, “I still have no
neck tie to wear, for my old one is in
shreds. How is it you are willing to
take so much trouble for me?”</p>

<p>The Fairy Shoemaker replied,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A rat-a-tat, tat, you’re a little lad,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Not always good, and not always bad.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The Fairy Shoemaker takes a turn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">As to be on time you wish to learn.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the most surprising thing happened!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="101" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

<p>Tardy Ted looked down at his feet and
saw the cutest little watch that sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I can make up a song and rhyme,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I can help you to be on time.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tardy Ted could find no owner for the
watch so he put it in his pocket and from
that moment everything went well.</p>

<p>He got home in time for supper, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
there was his coat with the buttons upon
it. There were his shoes all mended
and Father laid down a mysterious package
on the table.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In it was a neck tie of bright red,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The very thing for Tardy Ted.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He was happy as happy could be, and
next day spoke his piece well. He decided
that the little watch was a magic watch.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He said, “You set my heart a-flutter,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will hurry or be late to supper;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">To be on time and sit at table;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You keep on ticking as a rule,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will be on time to school;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To Tardy Ted I know you’ve said</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">I will set you now an hour ahead,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So I’ll lose the name of Tardy Ted.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From that hour Tardy Ted surprised
every one by being on time, and sometimes
he was really a little ahead of time.

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“What became of the Fairy Shoemaker?”
asked Pretty Bunny.</p>

<p>“What became of Teddy On Time?”
asked Healthy Bunny.</p>

<p>Aunt Etiquette’s head went nid-nid
nodding and she fell asleep.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny saw by the clock it was
quarter of eight and she whispered to
Healthy Bunny,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Don’t you know what the story said?</div>

<p>The Family Clock remarked,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“I could hear that whisper round the block,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Those two little Bunnies went pitter,
patter, up stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>Healthy Bunny looked under the pillow
and what do you suppose he saw?
There were two, shining silver watches.
On the back of each was written,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tick, tick, tock, hear me chime,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Both Bunnies went to sleep dreaming
of the Fairy Shoemaker.</p>

A PICK-IT-UP TALE.</h2>

    <div class="verse indent0">To pick up things please don’t forget;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ve one more thing to tell you yet:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To pick up things you’ll form the habit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If you are a well-mannered Rabbit.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One morning Aunt Etiquette came
down stairs and found everything in the
living room in disorder. Healthy Bunny
had thrown the newspapers on the floor
the night before, and Pretty Bunny had
left faded flowers in a vase.</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny had been on the sofa
and the pillows were all upset.</p>

<p>Even the chairs in the room looked
awkward, for they were not in their usual
places.</p>

<p>A few crumbs were also on the floor for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
Pretty Bunny had been careless while
eating a cookie, so Aunt Etiquette sat
down in a willow rocker and sighed and
sighed.</p>

<p>When the Bunnies came down stairs
they said, “What is the matter, Aunt Etiquette?”</p>

<p>She must have waved a wand or said
a magic verse for the newspaper said in
a crisp voice,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I often made the remark before,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I don’t BELONG upon the floor’.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Healthy Bunny picked up the newspaper
in the twinkling of an eye, and the
faded flowers said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Don’t leave faded flowers around,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">No telling by whom they’ll be found.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny threw the flowers out
and washed the vase neatly, then the pillows
on the old couch said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pick us up before you go to bed.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Bunnies gave them a great
straightening and the furniture began
to sigh,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Chairs in the corners, chairs in a row,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">In the proper place each chair should go.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>My, how easily the chairs were put
where they belonged and the Bunnies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
then discovered the crumbs on the floor
and used a carpet sweeper, before another
word could be said. Then Aunt Etiquette
smiled but said, “We are so late
I will let you help get breakfast and then
I will read you a real ‘Pick-Up Story’.”</p>

<p>After breakfast Aunt Etiquette began
the story of “Polly Pick-It-Up.”</p>

<p>She began,</p>

<p>“Once upon a time Polly wanted to
go on a visit.”</p>

<p>“Was it a Polly Rabbit or a Polly
Parrot?” asked Pretty Bunny.</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny said, “Was she going to
make you a visit, Aunt Etiquette?”</p>

<p>It was some time before Aunt Etiquette
began her story again and the
Family Clock sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tick, tick tock, I am right,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To interrupt is not polite.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Aunt Etiquette began once more,</p>

<p>“Once upon a time Polly wanted to go
on a visit and she asked mother who replied,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="109" style="max-width: 51.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/109.jpg" alt="bunny looking a clock">

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ask the old Family Clock,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Who always sings ‘Tick, tock’.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At this point in the story Aunt Etiquette’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
Family Clock pricked up its ears
to listen.</p>

<p>“Polly said politely to the clock, “May
I go on a visit to-day?”</p>

<p>The Family Clock replied,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The Family Clock would not mind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">If you’d use my key to wind.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Polly took the hint and wound up the
Clock who continued,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Do look at the full Waste Basket,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Stop a minute, please, and ask it.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So, Polly asked the Waste Basket,
“May I go on a visit to-day?” The basket
replied,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To anything I will agree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">If you’ll stop and empty me.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Polly thought that a very broad hint,
so she emptied the basket and a new
voice piped up,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Who will pick up the centre table?</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Polly dear, I think you’re able.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>
<p>Polly began to straighten the books
and put the magazines in even piles and
put away the candy box. She picked up
for herself and all the family, and she
heard a voice say,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A duster makes old things just shine;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Polly Pick-It-Up, that is fine.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So it went on all day long, everything
called to Polly to pick it up, and at evening
mother said, “I don’t see how I could
keep house without Polly Pick-It-Up. It
is such a comfort to come in and find the
living room in order.”</p>

<p>Father said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“She shall have her visit, never fear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Uncle Education is almost here.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At that very minute there was heard
the gallop of horses’ feet, and in less time
than it takes to tell it, Uncle Education
stood in the door-way, saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I have just a minute to stay;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Will some one ride with me to-day?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Every one wanted to ride with Uncle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
Education, of course, as he was on horse
back, but mother settled the matter by
saying,</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="112" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/112.jpg" alt="bunnies on horse">

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Polly Pick-It-Up should go,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">She is the most helpful child I know;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">She winds the Clocks and sets them right,</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">She emptied out the old Waste Basket</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">Polly Pick-It-Up has pluck,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">So she deserves to have Good Luck.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Polly Pick-It-Up was soon seated on
the old horse’s back in front of Uncle
Education and they went trotting, trotting
along.</p>

<p>At this very minute in the reading of
the story Aunt Etiquette sat still.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny put her paw up to her
ear to listen.</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny cried, “Hurrah, hurrah,
hurrah, I hear the “click, click, click,” of
horses’ feet, and they sound as though
they were coming nearer every minute.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, a horse was coming down
the road, and, sure enough, it stopped,
and in a few minutes a Bunny was rapping,
tapping on the door. He carried
a very sleepy Bunny and he bowed low
and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’m starting on a short vacation;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">My name is Uncle Education.</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">I am tired beyond a doubt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">For I teach year in, year out;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Long ago I think we met,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I hope you’re well, Aunt Etiquette.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

  <img class="w100" src="images/114.jpg" alt="bunnies at table">
</figure>

<p>Pretty Bunny and Healthy Bunny
stood with their mouths open, for it was
such a wonderful ending to a story.
Polly Pick-It-Up made a bow and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Aunt Etiquette, ’tis thus I greet you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I am very glad to meet you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>
<p>Then, there was a great introducing
all around, and the little Bunnies went out
to play. To their surprise another Bunny
greeted them and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I often sing a little rhyme,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I am your friend, Teddy On Time.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Pretty Bunny and Healthy
Bunny cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“How do you do? How do you do?</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The stories in that book are true;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Polly Pick-It-Up and Teddy On Time,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">You are well known in every clime.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Those four cute little Bunnies played
ball until it was time for dinner.</p>

COMPANY MANNERS</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Company manners you’ll not regret,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">If you learn to behave,” said Aunt Etiquette;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“At home if you have good manners, you see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">You’ll also behave well in company.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After dinner Uncle Education began
to talk,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To promote good health is my vocation,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I’m busy,” said Uncle Education;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Good English, too, now as a rule,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I teach at home, abroad, in school;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The hours pass on, I must be swift,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I’ve many lessons to teach in thrift.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Bunnies whispered a little among
themselves, for Uncle Education used
so many big words they could not understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
all he said. Aunt Etiquette
spoke quietly to Polly Pick-It-Up, who
whispered more than the rest. She said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When we are in company,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">We should listen respectfully.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Just then Teddy On Time left the
room without asking to be excused, and
he slammed the door after him.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="117" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/117.jpg" alt="bunny running">

<p>Uncle Education then said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“There’s something often to me sings,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">We should have manners in little things;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I’ve often said this thing before,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">We can learn to quietly close a door.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="118" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/118.jpg" alt="two bunnies">

<p>When Teddy On Time came back he
walked in front of Uncle Education who
remarked quietly,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Say ‘EXCUSE ME’, lad or lass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">When in front you have to pass.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Polly Pick-It-Up was very bright and
she said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I can teach one lesson soon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Rise when any one enters the room.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="119" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/119.jpg" alt="two bunnies">
</figure>

<p>Uncle Education said if we practise
good manners every day we will not
need to think about manners particularly
when visitors come. We will just
naturally be polite and have good manners
always.</p>

<p>At this very minute the postman
brought two letters.</p>

<p>One was for Uncle Education saying he
was needed at once in school, and the
other was from Old Mother Bun saying
that Father Bun would call next day
for Pretty Bunny and Healthy Bunny,
for Healthy Bunny had stayed on as
Aunt Etiquette had politely asked him
to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>Pretty Bunny sat down and cried out,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I can’t wear a clean dress, I haven’t another;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I never told my misfortune to mother;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Will Bunny Brag never, never come</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">With my lost suit-case to take home?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No one answered this for, of course,
no one knew where Bunny Brag was.</p>

<p>Uncle Education shook hands with all
his friends and said if he chanced to
meet Bunny Brag he would direct him
to Aunt Etiquette’s house. He said to
Aunt Etiquette,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I think you are a near relation;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Good bye, says Uncle Education.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Aunt Etiquette bade him good bye;
then Polly Pick-It-Up said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I, too, must travel on my way;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I thank you for a pleasant stay.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Teddy On Time said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’ve learned some things I’ll not forget;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Good bye, dear Old Aunt Etiquette.”</div>
  </div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>Then Pretty Bunny and Healthy Bunny
and Aunt Etiquette were left together,
and Pretty Bunny said, “Won’t
you please read us another story, Aunt
Etiquette?”</p>

<p>Aunt Etiquette said, “I will read you
a short story about “The Good Luck
Bunny.”</p>

<p>“Once upon a time there was a Good
Luck Bunny. She got up every morning
with a smiling face and was polite to
every one.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She always said she had better</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Answer every single letter;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She travelled over and over again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And had good manners on the train;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She always kept her bed-room neat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To enter it was quite a treat;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At the table, at home, in school,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Politeness was to her the rule.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She met you with a smile quite sweet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And had good manners on the street,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And though we thought her name was funny,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We always called her “Good Luck Bunny.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="122" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/122.jpg" alt="bunny fell">
</figure>

<p>One day Good Luck Bunny stubbed
her toe and fell. She got up quickly
saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I will be brave, ’twill bring me luck,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And that’s another name for PLUCK.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As she did not cry a bit her eyes were
bright and she looked down and saw
she had stubbed her toe on a bright,
shining dollar, so she had money enough
to take a trip.”</p>

<p>At this very minute in the reading
of the story, Healthy Bunny’s eyes grew
as big as tea-cups, and Pretty Bunny’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
eyes grew as big as saucers, for they
all heard some one singing distinctly,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Ha, ha, ha, it is so funny,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I am here, the Good Luck Bunny’.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As the story ended, there stood the
Good Luck Bunny on the door step. She
brought good luck to every one wherever
she went, so they were delighted to
see her.</p>

<p>Next came Old Father and Mother
Bun together.</p>

<p>Said Old Mother Bun,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I wish to thank Aunt Etiquette</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">For care of Pretty Bunny;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To-day I brought Aunt Etiquette</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">A little pot of honey.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At this very minute Old Mother Bun
looked at Pretty Bunny’s soiled dress.
She said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pretty Bunny, right now, I guess,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">You had better go and change your dress.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny started up stairs. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
she got to the top step of the stair-case,
she did not know what to do, for, of
course, she had no clean dress to put on.</p>

<p>There were only Bunny Boy’s clothes
in the suit-case.</p>

<p>The Good Luck Bunny followed her
and whispered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Now please don’t cry, have a little pluck,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I’ve really come to bring Good Luck.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She slipped a little key round Pretty
Bunny’s neck and scampered down stairs.</p>

<p>At that minute Pretty Bunny got up
and went into her room. She looked out
the window and what should she see but
Bunny Brag coming that way with the
long lost suit-case.</p>

<p>The Good Luck Bunny had given her
the key.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny ran out the back door
and met him and they were glad, indeed,
to exchange suit-cases. He could not
help bragging a little so he said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My clothes are better any way</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
    <div class="verse indent1">Than yours, so I will say good day.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Off he went.</p>

<p>Back into the house crept Pretty
Bunny and put on a fresh dress and
sun-bonnet, and to this day Old Mother
Bun does not know why Pretty Bunny
was so long changing her dress.</p>

<p>At last the time came to say good
bye, and the visitors got in the buggy
and started off, when Pretty Bunny said,</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother Bun, I must go back, I forgot
something.”</p>

<p>So they stopped and let Pretty Bunny
go back.</p>

<p>She ran up to the mirror and cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I almost forgot you, that was funny,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Good bye, good bye, Looking-Glass Bunny.”</div>
  </div>

<p>She smiled and the Looking-Glass
Bunny smiled back saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Whenever you want me I will come</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To your own mirror, now at home.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Next, Pretty Bunny kissed Aunt Etiquette
on both cheeks, saying,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="126" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’ve had a good time, I’ll not forget</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Lessons I learned from Aunt Etiquette.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Next she peeped into her bed-room
and a voice greeted her,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’m Bed-Room Bunny, I’m glad you’ve come;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I will meet you really again at home.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am so happy, I can’t tell why,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Bed-Room Bunny, good bye, good bye.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Next she ran out, and turning, called
to Shadow Bunny,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I love you better than shining money,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
    <div class="verse indent1">Good bye, good bye, dear Shadow Bunny.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Shadow Bunny replied,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I make friends with every one,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">But most of all with the shining sun.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Pretty Bunny called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Echo Bunny why, oh why, oh why,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Do I not find you? Good bye, good bye.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Echo Bunny did not appear but called,
“Good bye.”</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny climbed into the buggy
and they rode merrily homeward.</p>

<p>The very first question Old Father
Bun asked when they got home and sat
round the fire was,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Will some one tell me now who dares,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Who went ‘pitter, patter’ on the stairs?”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent1">Old Mother Bun took up her work basket</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And said, “My dear, I forgot to ask it.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent1">Healthy Bunny said, “I regret</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I never asked Aunt Etiquette.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent1">PRETTY BUNNY SAID, WITH A LAUGH SO FUNNY,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“I THINK IT WAS THE ECHO BUNNY.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
